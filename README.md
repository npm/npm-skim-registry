# npm-skim-registry

[Mcouch](http://npm.im/mcouch) for npm registries.  The opposite of
[npm-fullfat-registry](http://npm.im/npm-fullfat-registry).

[![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/185fe5071b01008479f47c654f86cdbc/m/ "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/bykey/185fe5071b01008479f47c654f86cdbc)

This moves attachments to the targets specified in multifs config, but then
*also* deletes them out of the couchdb.  It avoids then deleting them out of
multifs targets by setting a `{skip: true}` value for each attachment
associated with a published version.

This results in deleting attachments that don't belong (except for
`favicon.ico` on the `npm` doc, which is a special magical snowflake),
but keeping attachments in multifs targets if they are needed for a published
version, even as they are removed from couchdb.

You probably don't need this. It's super niche.  More likely, if
you're even reading this, you want either [mcouch](http://npm.im/mcouch)
or [npm-fullfat-registry](http://npm.im/npm-fullfat-registry).

## USAGE

```javascript
Skim({
  client:        multiFSClient,
  source:        myCouchDBUrl,
  sequenceFile:  '.sequence',
  inactivity_ms: 60*60*1000,
  delete:        true
}).on('put', function(doc) {
  console.log('PUT %s', doc._id);
}).on('rm', function(doc) {
  console.log('RM %s', doc._id);
}).on('send', function(doc, file) {
  console.log('-> sent %s/%s', doc._id, filename);
}).on('delete', function(doc, remote) {
  console.log('-> deleted %s/%s', doc._id, remote);
});
```
